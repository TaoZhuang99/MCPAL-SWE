1. Before running the program, please execute 'AWPAL.m' to ensure all files are in the MATLAB working directory. 

2. Note: To obtain a two-dimensional sound field of a linear PAL array, it is necessary to first run 'PreCal_PAL_array_2D_Demo.m' to obtain the two-dimensional coupled sound field between two elements. 
This step may take a long time, please be patient or reduce the maximum summation order 'nuMax'. 
After running it, please save the relevant data, and then run 'PAL_array_2D_Demo.m' to obtain the two-dimensional audio sound field of the linear PAL array.
